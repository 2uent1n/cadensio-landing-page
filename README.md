**Status:** Early-stage side project built as a learning experience. Currently working towards a functional MVP.

## Tech Stack

- **UI Components:** React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

The main application uses **Angular** for the frontends (business management platform + customer-facing app) and **NestJS** for the backend.

## Why This Exists
